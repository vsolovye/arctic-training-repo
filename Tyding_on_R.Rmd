## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F}
library(dplyr) 
library(tidyr)
```
Read in data from [https://knb.ecoinformatics.org](catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1"),

```{r}

head(catch_url)                             
```

```{r}
catch_df <- catch_url %>% 
select(-All, -notesRegCode)

# select(Region, Year, Chinook,...)
head(catch_df)
```

```{r}
catch_df %>%

# this table is a mistake

```{r}
